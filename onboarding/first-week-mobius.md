##### **Android Onboarding**


# **Mobius**
Mobius is our recommended architecture for building Android applications. We also feel that it is much easier to learn Test-Driven Development by starting out to build apps using Mobius.


### Day 1: Introduction to Mobius & TDD (4:50 hours)
*   Theory: Introduction to Mobius _(1 hour)_
    *   Eliminating the moving parts using functional programming
    *   Pure functions
    *   State transition diagrams
    *   `Model` & `Event`
*   Pairing Activity: The counter app state transition diagram _(1 hour)_
    *   The `update()` function
    *   Introducing the `UpdateSpec` class
    *   Test driving the counter `update()` function
    *   Wiring the `update()` function to the UI
*   Theory: Test-Driven Development _(30 minutes)_
    *   Principles of TDD
    *   [YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) 
    *   The red, green, and refactor cycle
    *   TDD as a design practice
*   Recap _(20 minutes)_
    *   Key takeaways
    *   Reading materials for the next day

### Day 2: Mobius Effects & Effect Handlers (5:05 hours)
*   Reflection of Day 1 and discussion around reading materials _(30 minutes)_
*   Pairing Activity: Login Screen `update()` Exercise _(2 hours)_
    *   Introducing effects & effect handlers
    *   Login example state transition diagram
    *   Test driving the login update() function
    *   Identifying the primitive obsession code smell (Watch this)
    *   The “What to test?” problem
    *   Relationship between the number of execution paths and tests
    *   Test driving the `Username` and `Password` classes
    *   Modeling async state transitions
    *   Completing the `update()` function
*   Pairing Activity: Materializing effects using effect handlers _(1:30 hours)_
    *   State verification vs. behavior verification
    *   Introduction to Mockito
    *   Low confidence behavior verification tests
    *   Writing the first effect handler
    *   Using the RxJava `SubtypeEffectHandler`
    *   `Action`, `Consumer`, and `ObservableTransformer`
    *   Errors of first-class citizens
    *   Using `Scheduler` in tests
*   Pairing Activity: Introduction to Views and View Renderers _(45 minutes)_
    *   Using mockito to verify view rendering logic
*   Recap _(20 minutes)_
    *   Key takeaways


### Day 3: Mobius, the final bits (5:35 hours)
*   Reflection of Day 2 _(30 minutes)_
*   Pairing Activity: Creating the shell _(45 minutes)_
    *   Wiring all the Mobius components
    *   Saving and restoring model state
    *   The `@Parcelize` annotation
    *   Caveats of saving data using Android’s `Parcelable` interface
*   Pairing Activity: Subtle bugs introduced by async operations _(45 minutes)_
    *   Handling normal flow of execution using the `init()` function
    *   Handling edge cases using the `init()` function
    *   Using the `InitSpec` for testing normal flow and edge cases
*   Recap _(20 minutes)_


### Day 4, 5, and (possibly 6): Building the NASA APOD Apps (14:50 - 22:50 hours)
*   Reflection of Day 3 _(20 minutes)_
*   Individual Activity: NASA APOD Application _(8 - 16 hours)_
    *   Step 1: Drawing the state transition diagram
    *   Step 2: Writing the `init()`the `update()` tests
    *   Step 3: Writing Effect Handler tests
    *   Step 4: View and View Renderer Tests
    *   Step 5: Wire up the imperative shell
*   Code review and addressal _(1:30 hours)_
*   Recap _(1 hour)_


### Points of Confusion
*   `Effect` are more closer to intention for side-effect than performing a side-effect
*   Representing decision making in state diagram
